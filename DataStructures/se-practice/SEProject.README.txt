Class Schedule Generator 


Selecting a course schedule can be a mess. There are a number of factors to consider which 
can all be at conflict with one another. Timing, requirements, credits, and rigor are all 
factors that need to be considered when selecting a productive schedule. Our program 
allows the user to generate his schedule with ease, relieving hours of work with the press 
of a single button.


This program is meant for college students selecting classes while balancing scheduling, 
prerequisites, credits, and major requirements.


Our software provides the ability to receive a pre-made schedule that takes into account
the aforementioned factors.


The user begins by inputting his basic information - major, classes already taken, and 
maximum and minimum number of credits allowed. Next, the user will be presented with a 
number of potential factors that he can select and edit at his disposal, such as the 
number of credits he wishes to take, the time he wishes to take such classes, which 
classes must be taken in the coming semester, which core requirements he would like to 
fulfill, difficulty of course, likability of professor.
